<h1 id="fine-tune-your-targeting-options">Fine-tune your targeting options</h1>

<p>One of Facebook's best features is targeting. When you reach out to your prospects on Facebook, you can get up to 90% accuracy. Yet, advertisers struggle to balance this precision when you can mix and match different targeting options.</p>

<h2 id="always-start-with-your-objectives">Always start with your objectives</h2>

<p>Before you start any marketing campaign, ask yourself what is your objective. What goal are you after? Are you looking to increase traffic, or do you want more conversions? Your answer affects your targeting options.</p>

<h3 id="broad-targeting">Broad targeting</h3>
<p>Broad targeting is the combination of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic targeting (demographic and location)</li>
  <li>Interests (a list of topics, Pages or keywords your audience is interested in)</li>
  <li>Behaviour (create an audience based on the device they use, and past or intended activities such as purchases or travels)</li>
  <li>Demographics (life events, relationship status and the likes)</li>
</ul>

<p>✔︎ It is useful when you need to generate awareness, or when you are building your brand. </p>

<p>✔︎ Combining broad targeting with an adequate CPM bidding will help you win more impressions.</p>

<p>✘ Make sure that your target is not too broad, and that your audience is not too wide compared to the total potential audience for the country you target.</p>

<p>✘ Do not use broad targeting if you know exactly who your audience is, or if you are looking for retargeting options.</p>

<h3 id="custom-audience-targeting">Custom Audience targeting</h3>

<p>Custom Audience targeting is the combination of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Custom Audiences, which allows you to specify a list of users you want to reach by using emails or phone numbers</li>
  <li>Website Custom Audiences, which allows you to retarget people based on their browsing patterns and events happened on your website</li>
  <li>Mobile Custom Audiences, which allows you to retarget people based on usage of your mobile app</li>
  <li>Lookalike Audiences (find more users similar to those already in your Custom Audiences)</li>
</ul>

<p>✔︎ Use Custom Audience targeting to make the most of your CRM data. For instance, you can run campaigns against returning customers who purchase at least than $100 per month.</p>

<p>✔︎ You can also use Custom Audience targeting to exclude people from your targeting. If you want to get more signups for your ecommerce, you can use Custom Audiences to prevent your existing users to see your ad.</p>

<p>✔︎ You can pass events to Mobile Custom Audiences and Website Custom audience via JavaScript, and then you can create a Lookalike Audience from that. If you are tracking add to carts, you can create a Lookalike Audience to find more people interested in performing the same action.</p>

<p>✘ The smaller your Custom Audience is, the more aggressively you will need to bid. oCPM is great in these situations, but in general CPM is recommended.</p>
